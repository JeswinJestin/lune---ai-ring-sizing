# Updated UI Mockups

## AR Instruction Overlay
- Style: Glass morphism with `backdrop-blur-2xl`, semi-transparent white, soft shadow.
- Placement: Centered only when hand is not detected.
- Behavior: Non-blocking (`pointer-events-none`).

## Controls Drawer
- Bottom gradient panel with nudge controls and sliders.
- Zoom slider range widened for better control.

## Overlay Hierarchy
- Ring overlay positioned with `pointer-events-none` and minimal z-index to avoid obscuring key UI elements.
